Tasked to design a new social media network, inspired by existing platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram, that connects individuals and businesse.

Your website should include the following features:
1. A login system allowing users to register or log in (login is only granted if user credentials are verified in the database).
2. A registration form to collect basic user details and store them in the database.
3. A login functionality where users can log in using their email and password. Note: The email should be unique. If the user is already registered, provide options such as login or forget password to help them access their account.
4. Once logged in, a user timeline should be created where users can share posts and pictures.
5. A user profile page featuring profile pictures and account holder names.
6. An option for users to view other users' profiles (including profile pictures and timelines).
7. A messaging feature allowing users to send messages to each other, with a search button to find specific users.
8. Utilize your personal discretion to enhance the social media siteâ€™s aesthetics using CSS3, JavaScript, or jQuery.
Note: The use of design technologies such as Bootstrap and WordPress is strictly prohibited.
